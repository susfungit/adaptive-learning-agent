      "explanation": "A 50:50 (1:1) ratio indicates a cross between a heterozygote (Tt) and a homozygous recessive (tt). If the tall parent were TT, all offspring would be tall. The 50% short offspring prove the tall parent must be Tt.",

      "explanation": "Each child has a 3/4 (75%) chance of brown eyes. For all four: (3/4)^4 = 81/256 = approximately 31.6%. This shows that probabilities multiply for independent events.",
